things the program has to do, in order:
 - copy its own binary to disk, on the first file of the root directory
 - save the compiler's source code to disk
 - copy the boot loader to disk as a backup
 - replace the bootloader with a new bootloader that loads the binary from the first disk and runs it
 - ask the user whether to run, edit, or compile
