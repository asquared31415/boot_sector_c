** FAT16 fs data in memory:
  - in memory there's a copy of the root directory data but organized in a way that's
  easier to process for fs operations.
  - fs structures are in a list fat16_root_data, and structures are identified by
    their file name
  - fat16_root_data is 0x4000 bytes in size, 0x80 root entries times 0x10 bytes per entry

  each fs structure contains:
  | offsets | data                                     |
  |  0..12  | file name in 8.3 format, null terminated |
  | 12..14  | start cluster of the file                |
  | 14..16  | size of the file in bytes                |
